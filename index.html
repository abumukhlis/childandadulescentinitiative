                        We believed that every pregnancy and birth is unique and by addressing inequalities that affect health outcomes, especially sexual and reproductive health and right and gender, is most fundamental to ensuring all women have access to respectful and high maternal care.

                        Armed conflict, child marriage, child labor, female genital mutilation and sexual exploitation of children can have long lasting effect on the psychological and well being of children. This can also leads to separation from their families and denial access to education and other essential services.

                    <p>
                        We believed that clean water, basic toilets and good hygiene practice are essential for the survival and development of children. According to UNICEF there are around 2.4 billion people who do not use improved sanitation and 663 million who do not have access to improved water resource especially in rural areas. Without these basic needs, the lives of children are at risk of water and sanitation related diseases which are one of the leading causes of death among Under-five children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In pursuance of the sustainable development goal to ‘ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’’ we work to fulfill the right of children and reach out to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children.
